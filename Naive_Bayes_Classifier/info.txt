This task is desisgned for Human pose recognition, with naive bayes classifier.
The data for this assignment is drawn from a yoga pose classification dataset created by Anastasia Marchenkova and released online here. Separate training and test datasets are provided; please report your results on the provided test set.
The pose keypoints were produced by a computer vision algo- rithm based on OpenPose. The algorithm identifies 11 keypoints on the body and returns their x and y values. 
The data is provided as a csv file; the first column is the name of the yoga pose and the remain- ing columns are the keypoints (11 x values followed by 11 y values). 
The body parts represented by each of the 11 keypoints are shown to the right.
Since the keypoint data was generated by a computer vision al- gorithm, it may contain some errors. Some instances have missing keypoints because a part of the body was not visible in the original image or the algorithm failed to detect it.
Missing keypoints have x and y values of 9999.
