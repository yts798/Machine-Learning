implement and evaluate a data linkage system

Abt and Buy both have product databases. In order to perform joint market research they need to link the same products in their databases. 
Therefore the research team has manually linked a subset of the data in order to build a linkage algorithm to automate the remaining items to be linked. 
This manually linked data is what you will base your work on in this assignment.
However the real dataset is unknown to you, as it would be reality and this unknown data is what you will be assessed on.
